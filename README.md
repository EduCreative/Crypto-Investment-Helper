## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is designed to run in an environment where `index.html` automatically imports and executes the `index.tsx` module.

### Environment Variables

For full functionality, the application requires API keys from various services. These keys must be available as environment variables in the execution context.

*   `API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key. This is required for all AI-powered features.
*   `CRYPTO_PANIC_API_KEY`: Your CryptoPanic API key. This is required for fetching real-time crypto news. If not provided, the app will use cached mock data.

The application will gracefully handle missing keys by disabling the corresponding features or falling back to mock data where possible.
